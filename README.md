An Attempt at CS61A (Scheme Version)

Using the course schedule for summer 2011 found [here](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su11/) (the modern version of the coutse is taught in Python), I'm attempting to follow along with the [video lectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter) by Brian Harvey, do the readings from [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start) and do the [homeworks and projects](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/nodate-hw.pdf).
Solutions for SICP exercies can be found online, but I can't find ones for the homework problems set from the course, so I'll be going with 'if it works, it's correct' for those :)

I'm using [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) with Simply Scheme dialect installed to mimic the language used in the Berkley class.
